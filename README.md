# Nogrod
Nogrod GUI

Nogrod is a script for Python 2.7 which uses the tk-interface of the current platform to enable quick and easy data processing and data manipulation. The script was designed to process and reshape data stored in textfiles (CSV or tabstopp separated) without the need to open them in statistical software packages. The program has a few easy to use routines which allow aggregation, combination, cross tabulation, and some basic analysis functions such as contingency analysis, for numerical and non-numerical data.

The program is based on the Angrist engine for content analysis data input and is specifically designed to read and process the data stored from Angrist. It may, however, be used for any kind of data which is stored in textfiles.

As of version 1.1, Nogrod may also be included as a module to any Python script. Upon inclusion, most of the functions of Nogrod may be called directly. The syntax is provided in the glossary in the appendix of the documentation.
